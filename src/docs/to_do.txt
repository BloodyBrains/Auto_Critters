RENDERING
    - Prevent the camera from moving out of the game world
        boundaries
    - Draw a battle map specific border around the IsoGrids
        so it doesn't appear to be floating in the void of 
        space. One way would be to create a png that is
        the same size as the the IsoGrid.full_map_surf with
        scenery just outside of where the grid will be drawn.
        This way it only ever needs to be blitted once.
