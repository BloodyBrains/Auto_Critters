#1 The full_map_surf Surface that the IsoGrid is blitted on 
    is a rectangle with origin at top left (0,0). The IsoGrid 
    is a diamond, with the origin at the center left. If the 
    IsoGrid is blitted on the full_map_surf Surface at the 
    origin, the top half of the grid will not get rendered because
    it would extend oustide of Surface bounds. To accomodate, the 
    y positions of the grid tiles must be shifted lower so the 
    entire grid fits on the full_map_surf Surface.
